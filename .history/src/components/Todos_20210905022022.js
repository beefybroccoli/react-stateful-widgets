#### Stretch Goal 1 (To-Do List)

Create a `Todos.js` file inside `src/components`. Find a tutorial online on how to build a to-do list in React using component state (no Redux!), and implement it. We should be able to render a list of to-dos, and cross out (or remove) individual to-dos to mark them complete.
