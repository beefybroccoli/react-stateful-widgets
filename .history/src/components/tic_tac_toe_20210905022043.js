#### Stretch Goal 2 (Tic-Tac-Toe)

Build another component inside this project with a game of Tic Tac Toe. The positions of the 'Xs' and the 'Os' over time need to be maintained in a slice of state, so that the JSX may display the contents of the 3 x 3 grid accurately. Only empty squares may be selected by the human player, and the event handler that deals with these clicks will have to include quite a bit of logic:

  1. Does the latest move by the human player mean **the game is over**? (Game over, then!)
  2. Is the game **immediately winnable by the computer** by making a certain move? (Make that move!)
  3. Can the computer **block the human from winning on their next move** by making certain move? (Prevent defeat!)
